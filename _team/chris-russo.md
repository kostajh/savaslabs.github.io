Chris has been a professional web developer since 2007 and made his first website on geocities.com when he was 11. He was a big fan of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blink"><code>&lt;blink&gt;&lt;/blink&gt;</code></a> and was deeply saddened when it became a deprecated element. For Savas, Chris most enjoys providing bespoke solutions for clients, and writing in the third person. When Chris is not behind the computer, heâ€™s probably doing something related to a bicycle. He is the Board President of nonprofit hospitality network [WarmShowers.org](https://www.warmshowers.org), serves on the board of his local bicycle advocacy organization [Bike Durham](http://www.bikedurham.org), founded a bicycle-powered food scraps recycling company called [Tilthy Rich Compost](http://www.tilthyrich.com), and rode his bicycle 6,000 miles across the U.S. in the summer of 2008.
